### A microservices architecture

- CustomerService (REST API) : Handles customer loan application form submission.
- LoanVerificationService (SOAP API) : Checks whether the requested loan amount is lower than the firm's maximum limit. If the amount exceeds the limit, the loan is rejected (NotificationService is called).
- RiskAssessmentService (gRPC API) : Evaluates the customer's financial profile based on banking activity. Returns a risk level (Low, Medium, High). If the risk is High and the loan is >= 20000, the loan is rejected (NotificationService is called).
- CheckValidationService (GraphQL API) : Requests a cashier's check from the customer. Then, validates the check with a bank service. 
- BankService (SOAP API) : If the check is validated, it requests funds from a Loan Provider Service and adds them to the customerâ€™s bank account. And, notifies the customer of the approval of the loan (NotificationService).
- NotificationService (REST API) : Notifies customers about loan approval or rejection via email/SMS.
